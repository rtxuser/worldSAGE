# worldSAGE 2017
    Using high throughput cDNA data and manipulating it so that it can be analysed. This project will be opensource.  


   The main goal of this project is to be of use to people, as there is a low quantity of opensource cDNA to merged aa sequence analysis. WorldSAGE is different from the regular SAGE techniques as it is all done from a computer. The best way on using worldSAGE would be to use in conjunction with dedicated memory and speed. Unlike regular SAGE processes, this version does not use tags-- using the whole sequence data as a tag will greatly improve the accuracy. Normal SAGE processes have too much room for error, thus worldSAGE was created to prevent such a thing from happening. Uses Opensource software such as EMBOSS' transeq and Mothur's merge tool.
