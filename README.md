# worldSAGE
Using high throughput cDNA data and manipulating it so that it can be analysed. This project will be opensource.  
The main goal of this project is to be of use to people, as there is a low quantity of opensource cDNA to merged aa sequence analysis. 
WorldSAGE is different from the regular SAGE techniques as it is done from a computer. The process in which normal SAGE processes have too much room for error, thus worldSAGE was created. Uses Opensource software such as EMBOSS' transeq and Mothur's merge tool.
